# PlotTest
 
XY chart example app.
For the X axis, this app obtains 100 random integers from a Rest API (JSON) and adds them to an A list, completing the list by adding 900 more random elements.
For the Y axis, the elements of list A are taken and a list B is created with the module 10 of its elements.
All the random integers are between 0 and 100.
